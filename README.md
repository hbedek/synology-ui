# Home Assistant Add-on: Z-Wave JS UI Proxy

⚠️ This addon does not contain Z-wave JS UI ⚠️

This addon acts as a proxy to an external running Z-wave JS UI instance. 
The sole purpose of this addon is to add a Z-wave JS UI icon to the sidebar of Home Assistant which will open the frontend of an external running Z-wave JS UI instance.

## Installation

Add github's link to you addon repository list.
Restart your Home Assistant, then go back to addon and select Z-wave JS UI Proxy.
Enjoy !

## Options

- `server` (required): this should be the local URL on which the Z-wave JS UI frontend is running, e.g. `http://192.168.1.222:8091` or even `https://192.168.1.222:8091`. Make sure there is no trailing slash!

## Extra
Default credentials to use Z-Wave JS UI are "admin/zwave"
